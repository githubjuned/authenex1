# AUTHENEX - Deepfake Hunter Lab

Authenex is a state-of-the-art digital forensic tool designed to identify synthetic media and AI-generated imagery. Utilizing Gemini 3 Pro's advanced visual reasoning, it detects artifacts that traditional algorithms miss.

## 🔬 Forensic Methodology
- **Ocular Consistency**: Checking pupil symmetry and iris reflections for lighting coherence.
- **GAN Signature Detection**: Identifying high-frequency noise patterns typical of Generative Adversarial Networks.
- **Biological Coherence**: Detecting "uncanny valley" indicators in hair strand rendering and skin pore distribution.
- **Environmental Warping**: Looking for background inconsistencies often found in Diffusion model outputs.

## 🚀 Features
- **File Analysis**: Upload high-resolution images for full neural scrubbing.
- **Multimodal Support**: Specialized detection modules for Images, Video, Audio, and Documents.
- **Detailed Forensic Logs**: Get a technical breakdown of *why* an image is flagged.

## 🛠️ Stack
- **AI**: Gemini 3 Pro (Vision Preview)
- **UI**: React 19 + Tailwind CSS
